## Guest Stories

3. **As a guest**, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can confirm my travel plans.

4. **As a guest**, I want to leave a review and rating after my stay so that I can share my experience.

## Host Stories

6. **As a host**, I want to view my upcoming bookings so that I can prepare for guests.

7. **As a host**, I want to receive messages from guests so that I can answer their questions.

## Admin Story
